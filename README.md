### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Basic summary of the data set.

* The size of training set is 39209
  * Maximum examples for a class: 2250
  * Minimum examples for a class: 210

* The size of test set is 12630

* The shape of a traffic sign image (after resizing) is (32, 32, 1)

* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

#### 2. Exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data is distributed across classes in training dataset.

Number of training examples before data augmentation :  39209

#### 3. Data Augmentation

The first issue that was addressed was dataset class skewness, this was done using augmenting the training dataset with random transformation. Random transformations include X-shift, y-shift, sheer, rotation. A utils function named `balance_training_dataset()` was created to augment dataset.

After augmenting the dataset the class distribution now were:

Below are class disitribution statistics after augmentation:

* Number of training examples after data augmentation :  96609

* Number of examples added to training dataset        :  57400

* Max examples for a class :  2250

* Min examples for a class :  2239

#### 4. Data Preprocessing

ImageDataGenerator was used to preprocess batches of images and split the training dataset into training dataset and validation dataset. Preprocessing operations performed were
- RGB to grayscale conversion
- resizing images from various resoltions to image size (32, 32)
- Normalization
- Zero Mean and uniform variance
- Histogram Equalization

Additionally, while training the network we randomly zoom the image.

The training-validation split is 0.30. The entire training dataset is divided into training dataset and validation dataset

#### 2. Training methodology

Adam Optimizer with intitial learning rate 5e-3 was used, however the learning rate was scaled down by a factor of 10 every 3 epochs if the validation-accuracy did not increase by 0.05%. The model configured to be trained for a maximum of 150 epochs but with an early stop on training if the validation-accuracy did not increase by 0.05% for 15 epochs. Eventually the training terminated early after 24 epochs. All activations from Convolution layers and fully-connected-layers were batch-normalized as well. Intermediate Fully Connected Layer were regularized using dropout with a dropout factor of 50% and final layer was regularized using l2 loss. Batch-size used was 512, and the model was trained on Nvidia Gt 1050Ti 4GB gpu for about 24 minutes.

#### 3. Model performance

* training set accuracy   : 0.9687 
* validation set accuracy : 0.9623 
* test set accuracy : 0.9615
* test set precision : 0.9552
* test set recall : 0.9336
* test set f1-score : 0.9394

#### 4. Training tradeoffs
- Initial model was based on LeNet architecture which had a test set accuracy of 0.90
- Later a higher capicity model was build to handle the augmented dataset
- Model performance improved when grayscale images were used instead of rgb images
- Batch Normalization significantly improved training speed
- Larger batch size helped the model to avoid overfitting

### Testing Model on New Images

84 traffic sign images from internet were collected and these images were saved in the directory `./data/examples/` in their appropriate class folders. Neural network model predicted the top 5 probable class labels for these example images. To see a detailed analysis of the Model prediction on random web images of traffic sign goto [notebook](https://github.com/svh2811/Traffic-Sign-Recognition/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). The analysis includes:
 * Ground truth class label
 * Image who's class label was predicted
 * Most likely class label
 * Top 5 most likely class labels
 * Bar chart showing the probability values of all 43 class probablities.


### Visualizing the Neural Network

Finally, the activations of Conv1 of Block-1 (for any 2 random images in the test dataset) were visualized. Conv1 layers seems to extract edge information from images at different angles.

### Observations

 - The model succesfully learns the pattern of the traffic images, this can be inferred from test set evaluation metric.
- Model not only learn the sign but also learns the shape of the sign board, this makes it difficult for the model to correctly classifly the same sign on a different shaped board.


### Future Work

- Augmenting the dataset with random brightness change
- Since the model is learning redundant features like, sign board shape, and additional preprocessing step that can be apllied is center the image
- Experiment with a model containing skip connections
